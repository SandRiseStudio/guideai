"""Rename work item types (epic→goal, story→feature) and story_points→points.

Part of GUIDEAI-491: Standardize work item terminology.

- Renames item_type values: 'epic' → 'goal', 'story' → 'feature' in work_items table
- Renames column: story_points → points in work_items table
- Recreates agent_workload view with updated column names (total_points)
- Maintains backward-compat aliases in the view for 1 release cycle
