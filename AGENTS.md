# Agent Handbook

> **TL;DR**: **Use the role that makes the most sense to begin with. Declare your role at task start.** Use GuideAI MCP tools directly (they work natively in VS Code Copilot Chat!).
> Log with Raze. Manage environments with Amprealize. Extract reusable code to `packages/`.
> Never hardcode secrets. Run `pre-commit` before pushing. **Cite both behavior AND role in your work.**
> Refer to WORK_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md for how to use the guideai platform for tracking work items, bugs, and project management.
> Use  ui-ux-pro-max skill for UI work.

## 🚨 Critical Rules (Always Follow)

| Rule | Behavior | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| Use MCP tools over CLI/API when available | `behavior_prefer_mcp_tools` | Consistent schemas, automatic telemetry |
| Use Raze for all logging | `behavior_use_raze_for_logging` | Centralized, queryable, context-enriched |
| Use Amprealize for environments | `behavior_use_amprealize_for_environments` | Blueprint-driven, compliance hooks |
| Never hardcode secrets | `behavior_prevent_secret_leaks` | Security, auditability |
| Run pre-commit before pushing | `behavior_prevent_secret_leaks` | Catches leaks before they reach git |
| Update docs after API/workflow changes | `behavior_update_docs_after_changes` | Keeps team aligned |

## 🎭 Agent Roles

> **Why Roles Matter**: The behavior handbook stores **procedural knowledge** (how-to strategies), distinct from
> declarative knowledge (facts). By operating in the correct role, you skip redundant re-derivation and
> reallocate compute to novel subproblems—achieving up to 46% fewer tokens while maintaining or improving quality.

GuideAI uses three roles inspired by [Meta's Metacognitive Reuse research](#-appendix-research-background):

| Role | Responsibility | Output Focus |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| **Student** 📖 | Consumes behaviors in-context or via fine-tuning (BC-SFT), executes with guidance | Efficient execution following established patterns |
| **Teacher** 🎓 | Generates behavior-conditioned responses for training data | Examples, documentation, behavior-conditioned training corpora |
| **Metacognitive Strategist** 🧠 | 1) Solves problems to produce traces, 2) Reflects on traces, 3) Emits behaviors | Pattern analysis, behavior curation, architectural decisions |

> **Note**: In the original research, Teacher generates training data and Student consumes/fine-tunes on it. GuideAI extends Teacher's role to include quality validation and behavior proposal approval for practical workflow integration.

### 🚦 Role Declaration Protocol (Required)

**At task start**, declare your role and rationale:

```
🎭 Role: Student
📋 Rationale: Following established patterns for [task description]
🔗 Behaviors: `behavior_use_raze_for_logging`, `behavior_prefer_mcp_tools`
```

**During execution**, if you need to escalate:

```
⬆️ Escalating: Student → Teacher
📋 Reason: Need to create reference examples for new API pattern
```

**In all work output**, cite both behavior AND role:

```
Following `behavior_use_raze_for_logging` (Student): Adding structured logging to endpoint...
```

### 📈 Role Escalation Triggers

| From | To | Trigger Conditions |
|------|-----|--------------------|
| **Student** | **Teacher** | Creating new examples or templates • Validating an unfamiliar approach • Writing documentation for others • Reviewing code quality • Explaining "how" or "why" to users |
| **Student** | **Metacognitive Strategist** | Same pattern observed 3+ times • Root cause analysis needed • No existing behavior fits • Architectural decision required • Post-mortem or retrospective |
| **Teacher** | **Metacognitive Strategist** | Gaps in behavior coverage discovered • Quality patterns need extraction • Cross-cutting concerns identified |

### 💡 Role Selection Decision Tree

```
START → Does an existing behavior cover this task?
  │
  ├─ YES → Is this routine execution?
  │         ├─ YES → Student 📖
  │         └─ NO (teaching/reviewing) → Teacher 🎓
  │
  └─ NO → Is this a novel problem requiring new patterns?
           ├─ YES → Metacognitive Strategist 🧠
           └─ NO (just needs examples) → Teacher 🎓
```

### 🎬 In Practice

```
User: "Add logging to the new endpoint"
🎭 Role: Student
📋 Rationale: Routine task with established behavior
Agent: Following `behavior_use_raze_for_logging` (Student), adding structured logging...

User: "Why do our tests keep failing on CI?"
🎭 Role: Metacognitive Strategist
📋 Rationale: Root cause analysis needed, may require new behavior
Agent: Analyzing patterns (Metacognitive Strategist). 1) Solving problem to produce trace, 2) Reflecting on trace, 3) Emitting behavior → proposing `behavior_fix_ci_flakiness`...

User: "Show me how to properly use Amprealize"
🎭 Role: Teacher
📋 Rationale: Creating reference examples for user learning
Agent: Demonstrating `behavior_use_amprealize_for_environments` (Teacher) with annotated examples...

User: "We keep having to manually fix import ordering"
⬆️ Escalating: Student → Metacognitive Strategist
📋 Reason: Pattern observed 3+ times, no existing behavior
Agent: Extracting new behavior (Metacognitive Strategist): 1) Solving import problem, 2) Reflecting on trace, 3) Emitting `behavior_enforce_import_ordering`...
```

## 🔄 Behavior Lifecycle (Metacognitive Reuse)

> **Core Principle**: Behaviors are **procedural memory**—reusable how-to strategies extracted from successful traces.
> This lifecycle ensures behaviors are proposed, validated, and integrated systematically, achieving the 46% token
> reduction documented in Meta's research while maintaining quality.

### Lifecycle Phases

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│  DISCOVER   │ →  │   PROPOSE   │ →  │   APPROVE   │ →  │  INTEGRATE  │
│  (Student)  │    │ (Strategist)│    │  (Teacher)  │    │    (All)    │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
      │                  │                  │                  │
  Observe 3+        Draft behavior     Validate quality   Add to handbook
  occurrences       with steps         & test on cases    & retrieval index
```

### Phase 1: DISCOVER (Student Role)

**Trigger**: While executing tasks, Students identify recurring patterns that lack existing behaviors.

**Student Discovery Protocol:**
```
🔍 Pattern Observed: [description of recurring situation]
📊 Occurrences: [count, ideally 3+]
📝 Current Workaround: [what steps are being repeated]
⬆️ Escalating: Student → Strategist for behavior extraction
```

**Example:**
```
🔍 Pattern Observed: Every time we add a new API endpoint, we manually add
   rate limiting, auth checks, and OpenAPI docs in the same order.
📊 Occurrences: 5 times in the last 2 weeks
📝 Current Workaround: Copy-paste from existing endpoint, modify fields
⬆️ Escalating: Student → Strategist for behavior extraction
```

### Phase 2: PROPOSE (Strategist Role)

**Trigger**: Strategist receives escalation OR discovers pattern during root cause analysis.

**Behavior Proposal Template:**
```markdown
## 📋 Behavior Proposal

**Name**: `behavior_<verb>_<noun>` (e.g., `behavior_scaffold_api_endpoint`)

**One-Line Summary**: [Single sentence describing the behavior]

**When (Triggers)**:
- [Condition 1]
- [Condition 2]

**Steps**:
1. [Step 1 with specific action]
2. [Step 2 with specific action]
3. [Validation step]

**Historical Validation**:
- [x] Would have helped in: [past case 1]
- [x] Would have helped in: [past case 2]
- [ ] Edge case to watch: [potential issue]

**Confidence Score**: [0.0-1.0, use 0.8+ for auto-approval]

**Proposed Role**: 📖 Student / 🎓 Teacher / 🧠 Strategist

**Retrieval Keywords**: [comma-separated for embedding search]
```

**Auto-Approval Threshold**: Behaviors with confidence ≥ 0.8 AND validation on 3+ historical cases can be auto-approved.

### Phase 3: APPROVE (Teacher Role)

**Trigger**: Teacher reviews pending behavior proposals.

**Teacher Validation Checklist:**
| Check | Question | Pass Criteria |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| ✅ Uniqueness | Does this duplicate an existing behavior? | No overlap with existing |
| ✅ Clarity | Are triggers unambiguous? | Clear when-to-use conditions |
| ✅ Completeness | Are steps actionable and verifiable? | Each step has a concrete output |
| ✅ Quality | Does historical validation pass? | Prevents 3+ past issues |
| ✅ Naming | Does name follow `behavior_<verb>_<noun>` pattern? | Consistent naming |
| ✅ Role Fit | Is proposed role appropriate? | Matches complexity level |

**Teacher Approval Actions:**
```
✅ APPROVED: Behavior `behavior_xyz` validated. Proceeding to integration.
   Quality Score: [0.0-1.0]
   Notes: [any modifications made]

❌ REJECTED: Behavior `behavior_xyz` not approved.
   Reason: [specific rejection reason]
   Suggestion: [how to improve proposal]

🔄 REVISION REQUESTED: Behavior `behavior_xyz` needs changes.
   Required Changes: [list of changes]
```

### Phase 4: INTEGRATE (All Roles)

**Trigger**: Approved behavior ready for integration.

**Integration Steps:**
1. **Add to AGENTS.md**: Insert behavior definition in `## 📖 Behaviors` section
2. **Update Quick Triggers**: Add keywords to trigger table with appropriate role
3. **Seed to BehaviorService**: Run `python scripts/seed_behaviors_from_agents_md.py`
4. **Update Retrieval Index**: Ensure embeddings are generated for semantic search
5. **Add Test Cases**: Create regression tests in `tests/test_behavior_*.py`
6. **Log in BUILD_TIMELINE.md**: Document behavior addition with date

**Integration Verification:**
```bash
# Verify behavior is retrievable
guideai bci generate --query "test query matching new behavior" --top-k 5

# Verify behavior appears in results
# Expected: New behavior in retrieved behaviors list
```

## 🎯 Role-Specific Behavior Responsibilities

### 📖 Student: Behavior Consumer & Pattern Scout

| Responsibility | Action | Output |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **Consume** | Retrieve and apply existing behaviors | Cite behavior in work output |
| **Scout** | Notice when tasks lack behavior coverage | Document pattern observations |
| **Escalate** | Report patterns occurring 3+ times | Formal escalation to Strategist |
| **Feedback** | Report behavior gaps or unclear steps | Improvement suggestions |

**Student MUST NOT**: Create new behaviors directly (propose only via escalation)

### 🎓 Teacher: Behavior Validator & Quality Gate

| Responsibility | Action | Output |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **Review** | Evaluate proposed behaviors for quality | Approval/rejection with rationale |
| **Validate** | Test behaviors against historical cases | Quality score (0.0-1.0) |
| **Improve** | Suggest refinements to proposals | Edited behavior definitions |
| **Document** | Create examples showing behavior usage | Reference implementations |
| **Mentor** | Help Students understand when to escalate | Guidance on pattern recognition |

**Teacher MUST NOT**: Propose behaviors (validation only, unless escalating to Strategist)

### 🧠 Metacognitive Strategist: Behavior Architect & Curator

> **Three-Step Process** (from research): 1) Solve a problem to produce a trace, 2) Reflect on the trace to identify generalizable steps, 3) Emit behaviors as entries.

| Responsibility | Action | Output |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **Solve** | Execute tasks to produce reasoning traces | Trace data for reflection |
| **Reflect** | Analyze traces to identify generalizable patterns | Behavior proposals |
| **Emit** | Draft new behaviors with full specification | Complete proposal template |
| **Curate** | Maintain handbook coherence, merge/split behaviors | Handbook maintenance |
| **Deprecate** | Mark obsolete behaviors, plan migrations | Deprecation notices |
| **Architect** | Design behavior retrieval and integration systems | System improvements |

**Metacognitive Strategist CAN**: Bypass Teacher approval for urgent/critical behaviors with documented justification

## 📊 Behavior Metrics & Health

Track these metrics to ensure the behavior handbook remains effective:

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Coverage Rate** | >80% of tasks covered | Tasks with applicable behavior / Total tasks |
| **Retrieval Accuracy** | >90% relevant | Correct behavior in top-K / Total queries |
| **Token Efficiency** | ≥30% reduction | Tokens with BCI / Tokens without BCI |
| **Behavior Freshness** | <30 days since review | Days since last validation |
| **Proposal Approval Rate** | 70-90% | Approved proposals / Total proposals |
| **Escalation Rate** | 10-20% of tasks | Tasks escalated / Total tasks |

**Health Indicators:**
- 🟢 **Healthy**: High coverage, low escalation, good token efficiency
- 🟡 **Attention**: Rising escalation rate = missing behaviors
- 🔴 **Unhealthy**: Low retrieval accuracy = stale or poorly-named behaviors

---

## 🔧 Standalone Services

When adding significant functionality, create a standalone package under `packages/`:

| Service | Purpose | Package | Install |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Raze** | Structured logging, telemetry | `packages/raze/` | `pip install raze[cli,fastapi]` |
| **Amprealize** | Environment/container orchestration | `packages/amprealize/` | `pip install amprealize[cli,fastapi]` |

**Pattern**: Zero guideai core deps → hooks for integration → optional extras `[cli,fastapi,dev]` → thin wrapper in `guideai/<name>/`

---

## 🛠️ Agent Etiquette

### Testing & Validation
- After every substantive change, run the smallest relevant check (`pytest`, `npm run build`, lint)
- Record command and outcome; if no automated check exists, perform smoke test and log result
- Use test runner run_tests.sh when running more the unit tests
-Use run_tests.sh with amprealize mode for consistent environment setup/management

### Environment & Secrets
- Never hardcode paths or secrets—use environment variables or `.env` files
- When a secret leaks, cite `behavior_rotate_leaked_credentials` and rotate immediately

### Service Calls & Tooling
- **MCP-first**: When MCP tools are available, prefer them over CLI/API calls
- Avoid loopback HTTP unless architecture explicitly separates services
- Make base URLs and credentials configurable

### Code Quality
- Keep edits focused on active behaviors; note additional debt under "next steps"
- Preserve correctness, keep diffs minimal, guard edge cases
- Avoid blanket fixes—diagnose root cause so symptoms don't reappear
- Account for backwards/forwards compatibility

### Documentation
- Update `README.md`, `PRD.md`, `BUILD_TIMELINE.md` when APIs/workflows change
- Cite `behavior_update_docs_after_changes` in summary

### Data Integrity
- Never discard, mask, or mutate user data silently
- When migrations are unavoidable, make them invertible or document recovery paths

---

## 📖 Behaviors

### `behavior_prefer_mcp_tools`
- **When**: Working in an IDE with MCP server extensions, or when guideai MCP tools could replace CLI/API interactions.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Check available tools**: GuideAI MCP server exposes **220 tools** including `behaviors.*`, `runs.*`, `compliance.*`, `actions.*`, `bci.*`, `raze.*`, `amprealize.*`, `projects.*`, `orgs.*`, `boards.*`. See `docs/contracts/MCP_SERVER_DESIGN.md` for full catalog.
  2. **Use MCP directly in VS Code Copilot Chat**: GuideAI MCP tools work natively—just invoke them by name (e.g., `mcp_guideai_projects_list`, `mcp_guideai_behaviors_getfortask`). No CLI fallback needed.
  3. **Prefer MCP over CLI/API**: MCP provides consistent schemas, automatic telemetry, and cross-surface parity.
  4. **Leverage IDE extensions**: VS Code Copilot Chat can invoke GuideAI tools directly for real-time behavior retrieval, project management, run status, and compliance validation.
  5. **Record usage**: Cite MCP tools in action logs for reproducibility.
  6. **Fallback gracefully**: If MCP unavailable (e.g., outside VS Code), use CLI commands with same parameters.
  7. **Report gaps**: Document missing MCP equivalents in `docs/capability_matrix.md`.

### `behavior_use_raze_for_logging`
- **When**: Adding logging to any service, debugging production issues, implementing telemetry, or replacing ad-hoc print statements.
- **Steps**:
  1. Import: `from raze import RazeLogger` or `from raze import RazeService`.
  2. Configure sink: TimescaleDB (production), InMemory (tests), JSONL (local).
  3. Include context fields: `run_id`, `action_id`, `session_id`, `actor_surface`.
  4. Use structured fields: `logger.info("Request processed", endpoint="/v1/users", latency_ms=45)`.
  5. For VS Code/web, use the `RazeClient` TypeScript wrapper.
  6. Query via REST (`/v1/logs/query`) or MCP tools (`raze.query`).

### `behavior_use_amprealize_for_environments`
- **When**: Provisioning development environments, managing containerized resources, setting up test infrastructure.
- **Steps**:
  1. Check if Amprealize is needed (container orchestration, compliance) or simpler Docker Compose suffices.
  2. Create/select blueprint from `packages/amprealize/src/amprealize/blueprints/`.
  3. Use plan/apply/destroy workflow: `amprealize plan --blueprint <name>`, review, then `amprealize apply`.
  4. Configure hooks for ActionService/ComplianceService when audit trails required.
  5. Monitor via `amprealize status`, clean up with `amprealize destroy`.
  6. Document new blueprints in `environments.yaml`.

### `behavior_extract_standalone_package`
- **When**: Adding functionality that could be reused across projects, or refactoring tightly-coupled code.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Evaluate reusability**: Is it generic enough to benefit other projects?
  2. **Follow Raze/Amprealize pattern**:
     - Create under `packages/<name>/` with `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `src/<name>/`
     - Zero guideai core dependencies; use hooks/callbacks
     - Define optional extras: `[cli]`, `[fastapi]`, `[dev]`
  3. **Design hook architecture**: Use dataclasses/protocols for integration points.
  4. **Create guideai wrapper**: Thin layer under `guideai/<name>/` wiring to ActionService/ComplianceService.
  5. **Add integration points**: FastAPI router factory, MCP adapter, CLI commands.
  6. **Verify installation**: Test `pip install -e ./packages/<name>` works independently.
  7. **Document**: Add README, update `WORK_STRUCTURE.md`, log in `BUILD_TIMELINE.md`.

### `behavior_prevent_secret_leaks`
- **When**: Initializing repos, preparing commits/pushes, wiring CI pipelines.
- **Steps**:
  1. Confirm `.gitignore` excludes secrets directories/files.
  2. Ensure `pre-commit` is installed via `./scripts/install_hooks.sh`.
  3. Run `scripts/scan_secrets.sh` before PRs; remediate immediately.
  4. Record `guideai scan-secrets` action with sanitized reports.
  5. Escalate recurring findings to Compliance; update `SECRETS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md`.

### `behavior_rotate_leaked_credentials`
- **When**: Secrets, keys, or credentials appear in code, logs, or chat.
- **Steps**:
  1. Remove leaked artifact from repo; ensure `.gitignore` blocks future commits.
  2. Instruct user to rotate affected credentials per `SECRETS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md`.
  3. If secret reached git history, document scrub steps (`git filter-repo`).
  4. Replace production secrets with placeholders in `.env.example`.
  5. Note incident in summary with remediation status.

### `behavior_unify_execution_records`
- **When**: Work involves run persistence, SSE updates, CLI status, or execution records.
- **Steps**:
  1. Inventory all execution record definitions and storage adapters.
  2. Align fields with RunService contract (`docs/contracts/MCP_SERVER_DESIGN.md`), ActionService payloads (`docs/contracts/ACTION_SERVICE_CONTRACT.md`).
  3. Route mutations through canonical RunService/ActionService APIs.
  4. Validate state transitions across Web/CLI/API/MCP surfaces.
  5. Add regression tests covering create/progress/complete/failure paths.

### `behavior_align_storage_layers`
- **When**: Modifying UnifiedStorage, JSON/SQLite/Firestore adapters, PostgresPool.

  1. Check for duplicate methods or mismatched field names.
  2. Normalize signatures per `docs/contracts/AUDIT_LOG_STORAGE.md` and `docs/contracts/REPRODUCIBILITY_STRATEGY.md`.
  3. Verify PostgresPool commits before returning connections.
  4. Update schema docs and indexes.
  5. Test across at least two backends.
  6. Document migrations in `BUILD_TIMELINE.md`.

### `behavior_externalize_configuration`
- **When**: Encountering hardcoded file paths, ports, Firebase configs, API keys.
- **Steps**:
  1. Add typed config entries via `config/settings.py`.
  2. Load from env vars/`.env` with safe fallbacks per `SECRETS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md`.
  3. Update Docker Compose, manifests, `.env.example`.
  4. Remove hardcoded values; fail fast with descriptive errors if missing.
  5. Refresh setup docs.

### `behavior_harden_service_boundaries`
- **When**: Code makes loopback HTTP calls, uses inline API keys, or crosses service boundaries inconsistently.
- **Steps**:
  1. Determine if call should be in-process or external client.
  2. For in-process, use direct service calls honoring contracts.
  3. For cross-service, configure URLs/credentials, add auth guards, log failures.
  4. Add integration tests.
  5. Remove hardcoded secrets; rotate if exposed.

### `behavior_curate_behavior_handbook`
- **When**: Updating behavior definitions, prompts, retrieval metadata, OR processing behavior proposals.
- **Role**: 🧠 Metacognitive Strategist (propose/curate) or 🎓 Teacher (validate/approve)
- **Steps**:
  1. **Review existing entries** to avoid duplicates—search by name and keywords.
  2. **For new behaviors**: Follow the Behavior Proposal Template (see Behavior Lifecycle section).
  3. **Include clear triggers**: Specific conditions that activate this behavior.
  4. **Define validation steps**: How to verify the behavior was applied correctly.
  5. **Assign appropriate role**: Student (routine), Teacher (examples), Strategist (novel).
  6. **Calculate confidence score**: Based on historical validation (0.8+ for auto-approve).
  7. **Update BehaviorService index**: Run `python scripts/seed_behaviors_from_agents_md.py`.

### `behavior_triage_incident`
- **When**: Production incident occurs, alert fires, user reports critical issue, or system degradation detected.
- **Role**: 📖 Student (follow runbook) or 🧠 Strategist (novel incident requiring new patterns)
- **Steps**:
  1. **Acknowledge immediately**: Claim incident in alerting system; notify on-call channel within 5 minutes.
  2. **Assess severity**: P1 (service down), P2 (degraded), P3 (minor impact), P4 (cosmetic) per `docs/INCIDENT_SEVERITY.md`.
  3. **Establish communication**: Create incident channel; post initial status with known impact, start time, responders.
  4. **Gather diagnostics**: Check dashboards (Grafana), logs (Raze), recent deployments, external dependencies.
  5. **Mitigate first, debug second**: Roll back if recent deploy, scale if capacity, failover if single point of failure.
  6. **Update stakeholders**: Post status every 15 minutes for P1/P2; include ETA, workarounds, blast radius.
  7. **Declare resolution**: Confirm metrics normalized; post summary with duration, impact, immediate fix applied.

### `behavior_write_postmortem`
- **When**: After incident resolution, significant outage, or near-miss that could have caused outage.
- **Role**: 🎓 Teacher (facilitate blameless retrospective) or 🧠 Strategist (extract systemic patterns)
- **Steps**:
  1. **Use template**: Copy `docs/templates/POSTMORTEM_TEMPLATE.md`; fill within 48 hours of incident.
  2. **Build timeline**: Chronological events from first signal to resolution; include timestamps, actors, actions.
  3. **Identify root causes**: Use 5 Whys or fishbone diagram; distinguish proximate cause from systemic issues.
  4. **Stay blameless**: Focus on systems and processes, not individuals; use "the system allowed" not "person X failed."
  5. **Define action items**: Each must have owner, due date, and success criteria; link to tracking tickets.
  6. **Quantify impact**: Users affected, revenue impact, SLA breach, reputation cost.
  7. **Review with team**: Hold postmortem meeting within 1 week; invite all responders and affected stakeholders.
  8. **Publish and track**: Store in `docs/postmortems/`; add action items to sprint; cite in `BUILD_TIMELINE.md`.

### `behavior_migrate_postgres_schema`
- **When**: Adding/modifying database tables, changing column types, adding indexes, or managing schema versioning.
- **Role**: 📖 Student (routine migrations) or 🎓 Teacher (complex schema redesigns)
- **Reference**: See `docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed examples and troubleshooting.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Check for single head**: Run `alembic heads` - must show exactly ONE head before creating migration.
  2. **Create migration**: Use `alembic revision -m "descriptive_name"` with clear action-oriented names.
  3. **Verify revision references**: Ensure `down_revision` uses the actual revision ID (not filename).
  4. **Include rollback**: Every migration must have corresponding `downgrade()` or be documented as irreversible.
  5. **Avoid unsupported params**: `create_index()` does NOT support `comment=` - use Python comments instead.
  6. **Test locally**: Run `alembic upgrade head`, verify, then test rollback with `alembic downgrade -1`.
  7. **Validate before commit**: Run `python scripts/validate_migrations.py` or let pre-commit check.
  8. **Handle data migrations**: For existing data, write idempotent transforms; never lose production data.
  9. **Update schema docs**: Reflect changes in `docs/contracts/AUDIT_LOG_STORAGE.md` and relevant service contracts.
  10. **Log in BUILD_TIMELINE.md**: Document migration number, purpose, and any breaking changes.

### `behavior_design_mcp_tool_schema`
- **When**: Creating new MCP tools, updating tool schemas, or making tools work in VS Code Copilot Chat without required parameters.
- **Role**: 📖 Student (follow pattern) or 🎓 Teacher (establish new patterns)
- **Reference**: See `docs/MCP_TOOL_SCHEMA_PATTERN.md` for detailed implementation guide.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Set required to empty**: In `mcp/tools/<tool>.json`, use `"required": []` unless parameters are truly mandatory.
  2. **Use session context**: Handler should check `arguments.get("_session", {})` for user_id, is_admin, accessible resources.
  3. **Fallback to session**: When explicit parameters not provided, use session context values.
  4. **Check admin status**: Call `_is_admin_from_session(arguments)` for elevated access patterns.
  5. **Verify access control**: Ensure user can access requested resources via `_check_org_access()` or `_check_project_access()`.
  6. **Update description**: Schema property descriptions should indicate "(optional, uses session)" when applicable.
  7. **Test with Copilot**: After changes, fully restart VS Code (Cmd+Q) to clear schema cache, then test tool invocation.
  8. **Document changes**: Update `docs/MCP_TOOL_SCHEMA_PATTERN.md` if establishing new patterns.

### `behavior_validate_cross_surface_parity`
- **When**: Adding features that should work identically across CLI, API, MCP, and web surfaces.

- **Steps**:
  1. **Identify affected surfaces**: List all surfaces where feature should be available (CLI, REST API, MCP tools, Web UI).
  2. **Map to existing parity tests**: Check `tests/test_*_parity.py` for relevant test patterns.
  3. **Write parity assertions**: Each surface should produce identical results for same inputs (modulo format).
  4. **Test error handling parity**: Verify error codes and messages are consistent across surfaces.
  5. **Check schema alignment**: Ensure request/response schemas match across surfaces; use shared Pydantic models.
  6. **Add regression tests**: Create `test_<feature>_parity.py` with parameterized tests for each surface.
  7. **Document surface matrix**: Update `docs/capability_matrix.md` with feature availability per surface.

### `behavior_integrate_vscode_extension`
- **When**: Adding new VS Code extension features, webview panels, tree data providers, or MCP client integrations.
- **Role**: 🎓 Teacher (design patterns) or 📖 Student (follow existing patterns)
- **Steps**:
  1. **Follow extension architecture**: New panels go in `extension/src/panels/`, providers in `providers/`, clients in `client/`.
  2. **Use TypeScript strictly**: Enable strict mode; define interfaces for all webview message types.
  3. **Handle activation correctly**: Register disposables in `activate()`; clean up in `deactivate()`.
  4. **Implement webview security**: Use CSP headers; sanitize all data from webviews; use nonces for scripts.
  5. **Connect to MCP**: Use `McpClient.ts` for backend communication; handle connection failures gracefully.
  6. **Add telemetry**: Use `RazeClient.ts` for structured logging; include `extensionId`, `command`, `duration`.
  7. **Test with Extension Test Runner**: Add tests in `extension/src/test/suite/`; mock VS Code APIs.
  8. **Update package.json**: Register commands, views, and activation events; bump version.
  9. **Document in README**: Add feature to `extension/README.md` with screenshots if visual.

### `behavior_conduct_code_review`
- **When**: Reviewing pull requests, providing feedback on code changes, or establishing review standards.

  2. **Check behavior compliance**: Verify PR cites relevant behaviors; check against `AGENTS.md` patterns.
  3. **Review for correctness**: Verify logic, edge cases, error handling, and test coverage.
  4. **Review for consistency**: Check naming conventions, code style, and patterns match existing code.
  5. **Review for security**: Check for hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, XSS, auth bypasses.
  6. **Review for performance**: Flag N+1 queries, missing indexes, unbounded loops, memory leaks.
  7. **Provide actionable feedback**: Use "Request changes" for blockers, "Comment" for suggestions.
  8. **Approve with confidence**: Only approve when you'd be comfortable deploying the change yourself.
  9. **Follow up on changes**: Re-review after requested changes are made; don't rubber-stamp.

### `behavior_craft_messaging`
- **When**: Writing user-facing copy, defining brand voice, creating marketing content, or standardizing terminology.
- **Role**: 🎓 Teacher (establish patterns) or 📖 Student (follow style guide)
- **Steps**:
  1. **Reference style guide**: Check `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md` or `AGENT_COPYWRITING.md` for tone, voice, and terminology standards.
  2. **Understand audience**: Identify target persona (developer, manager, end-user) and tailor language complexity.
  3. **Be concise**: Prefer active voice, short sentences, and concrete examples over abstract descriptions.
  4. **Use consistent terminology**: Map product concepts to approved terms; avoid jargon unless audience expects it.
  5. **Include CTAs**: Every piece should have clear next action; avoid dead-ends in user journey.
  6. **Test readability**: Aim for Flesch-Kincaid grade 8-10 for general audiences; technical docs can be higher.
  7. **Localization-ready**: Avoid idioms, puns, or culturally-specific references that don't translate.
  8. **Review with stakeholders**: Get sign-off from Product/Marketing before shipping user-facing copy.

### `behavior_create_data_pipeline`
- **When**: Building ETL processes, feature engineering pipelines, data quality checks, or analytics workflows.
- **Role**: 🎓 Teacher (design patterns) or 📖 Student (implement standard pipelines)
- **Steps**:
  1. **Define schema first**: Document input/output schemas with data types, nullability, and valid ranges.
  2. **Implement idempotently**: Pipeline reruns should produce identical results; use upserts over inserts.
  3. **Add data validation**: Check for nulls, outliers, schema drift at ingestion; fail fast with clear errors.
  4. **Handle late arrivals**: Design for out-of-order data; use watermarks or grace periods where needed.
  5. **Instrument thoroughly**: Log row counts, processing times, data freshness per `behavior_use_raze_for_logging`.
  6. **Version transformations**: Track transformation logic in version control; document breaking changes.
  7. **Test with representative data**: Use production-like samples; test edge cases (empty, malformed, large).
  8. **Set up monitoring**: Alert on data quality degradation, pipeline failures, unusual patterns.
  9. **Document lineage**: Map data flow from source to destination; update `docs/DATA_LINEAGE.md`.

### `behavior_design_test_strategy`
- **When**: Planning test coverage for new features, establishing testing standards, or improving test quality.
- **Role**: 🎓 Teacher (define strategy) or 📖 Student (follow test patterns)
- **Steps**:
  1. **Follow test pyramid**: 70% unit, 20% integration, 10% E2E; adjust based on architecture.
  2. **Define coverage targets**: Set minimum coverage per component; critical paths need >90%.
  3. **Identify test boundaries**: What's mocked vs. real? Document external dependency handling.
  4. **Write tests first**: For new features, TDD ensures testability; for bugs, write regression test first.
  5. **Use fixtures effectively**: Share setup via `conftest.py`; avoid test interdependence.
  6. **Test error paths**: Happy path is necessary but insufficient; test failures, timeouts, edge cases.
  7. **Keep tests fast**: Unit tests <100ms each; slow tests should be marked and run separately.
  8. **Maintain test quality**: Tests are code—review, refactor, and deduplicate test logic.
  9. **Integrate with CI**: All tests run on PR; coverage gates prevent regression.

### `behavior_manage_feature_flags`
- **When**: Adding gradual rollout controls, toggling features per user/percentage, or managing flag lifecycle.
- **Role**: 📖 Student (follow established patterns)
- **Steps**:
  1. **Register flag**: Use `FeatureFlagService.register_flag()` with name, type (BOOLEAN/PERCENTAGE/USER_LIST), and default value.
  2. **Check flags at runtime**: Call `feature_flags.is_enabled(flag_name, context)` — never hard-code feature checks.
  3. **Use consistent hashing**: PERCENTAGE flags use SHA-256 on `user_id + flag_name` for deterministic rollout.
  4. **Expose via CLI/MCP**: Flags are manageable through `guideai flags list|get|set` and MCP tools `flags.list`, `flags.get`, `flags.set`.
  5. **Migrate schema**: Use Alembic migration `20260319_add_feature_flags` for persistent storage; rollback supported.
  6. **Clean up stale flags**: Remove flags once fully rolled out; update MIGRATION_GUIDE.md if schema changes.
  7. **Test flag behavior**: Test both enabled/disabled paths; use `_build_loop_with_flag()` pattern in tests.

### `behavior_enforce_quality_gates`
- **When**: Validating behavior adherence before pack promotion, checking for regressions in evaluation metrics.
- **Role**: 📖 Student (follow established patterns) or 🎓 Teacher (define new gate types)
- **Steps**:
  1. **Define gate checks**: Use `QualityGateService.run_all_gates()` with behavior approval, pack validation, and regression checks.
  2. **Set thresholds**: Configure `adherence_min`, `hallucination_max`, `citation_min` per gate; use defaults when not specified.
  3. **Check regressions**: Compare current vs. baseline metrics; flag regressions exceeding configurable thresholds.
  4. **Store gate results**: Attach `QualityGateReport` to behaviors via `BehaviorService` quality gate hook.
  5. **Emit telemetry**: Fire `quality_gate.evaluated` and `quality_gate.regression_detected` events per TELEMETRY_SCHEMA.
  6. **Block promotion on failure**: `PackBuilder.validate_build()` delegates to quality gates; failing gates prevent pack builds.
  7. **Review failures**: Use comparison harness (`EvaluationService.compare()`) for detailed metric breakdowns.

### `behavior_bootstrap_pack_migration`
- **When**: Bootstrapping knowledge packs into existing workspaces, rolling back failed migrations, or detecting storage backends.
- **Role**: 📖 Student (follow established patterns)
- **Steps**:
  1. **Detect storage**: Use `StorageDetector.detect()` to identify backend (Postgres, SQLite, JSON, Unknown).
  2. **Bootstrap pack**: Call `PackMigrationService.bootstrap()` — creates tables/directories, seeds default config, applies pending migrations.
  3. **Verify status**: Use `guideai pack status` or MCP `pack.status` to confirm bootstrap success.
  4. **Rollback if needed**: Call `PackMigrationService.rollback()` to revert; idempotent and safe.
  5. **Handle backward compat**: `RuntimeInjector` gracefully handles missing ContextResolver, BehaviorRetriever, BCIService, or active pack.
  6. **Test all paths**: Test bootstrap + rollback for each storage backend; verify RuntimeInjector works with/without pack.

### `behavior_run_auto_reflection`
- **When**: Triggering automatic behavior reflection after execution runs, implementing learning loop feedback.
- **Role**: 📖 Student (follow established patterns)
- **Steps**:
  1. **Check feature flag**: Auto-reflection is gated by `ENABLE_AUTO_REFLECTION` feature flag; verify it is enabled.
  2. **Trigger after runs**: Reflection fires post-execution via `agent_execution_loop` integration.
  3. **Process through review queue**: Reflections route to review queue (`ReviewQueueService`) for approval/rejection.
  4. **Apply lifecycle policies**: Use `LifecyclePolicyService` to manage behavior promotion, deprecation, and archival.
  5. **Emit telemetry**: Fire events per TELEMETRY_SCHEMA for reflection triggers, queue operations, and policy applications.
  6. **Test with flag toggling**: Use `_build_loop_with_flag()` to test both enabled and disabled auto-reflection paths.

### Article that inspired GuideAI

**Meta AI Proposes 'Metacognitive Reuse': Turning LLM Chains-of-Thought into a Procedural Handbook that Cuts Tokens by 46%**

*By Asif Razzaq – September 21, 2025*
*Source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13237*

Meta researchers introduced a method that compresses repeated reasoning patterns into short, named procedures—"behaviors"—and then conditions models to use them at inference or distills them via fine-tuning.

**Results:**
- Up to **46% fewer reasoning tokens** on MATH while matching or improving accuracy
- Up to **10% accuracy gains** in self-improvement settings on AIME
- No model weight changes required

**The Problem:**
Long chain-of-thought traces repeatedly re-derive common sub-procedures (inclusion–exclusion, base conversions, geometric angle sums). This redundancy burns tokens, adds latency, and crowds out exploration.

**The Solution:**
Abstract recurring steps into concise, named behaviors (name + one-line instruction) recovered from prior traces via LLM-driven reflection, then reuse them during future reasoning.

**Three Roles, One Handbook:**
- **Metacognitive Strategist** (R1-Llama-70B in research): 1) Solves a problem to produce a trace, 2) Reflects on the trace to identify generalizable steps, 3) Emits behaviors as entries
- **Teacher** (LLM B): Generates behavior-conditioned responses used to build training corpora
- **Student** (LLM C): Consumes behaviors in-context (inference) or is fine-tuned on behavior-conditioned data (BC-SFT)

**Evaluation Modes:**
1. **Behavior-Conditioned Inference (BCI)**: Retrieve K relevant behaviors and prepend to prompt
2. **Behavior-Guided Self-Improvement**: Extract behaviors from earlier attempts as hints for revision
3. **Behavior-Conditioned SFT (BC-SFT)**: Fine-tune on teacher outputs that already follow behavior-guided reasoning

**Retrieval Mechanism:**
- Topic-based retrieval on MATH benchmarks
- Embedding-based retrieval (BGE-M3 + FAISS) on AIME benchmarks

**Why It Works:**
The handbook stores procedural knowledge (how-to strategies), distinct from classic RAG's declarative knowledge (facts). By converting verbose derivations into short, reusable steps, the model skips re-derivation and reallocates compute to novel subproblems.
