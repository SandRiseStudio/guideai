"""Hooks for integrating Amprealize with external services.

The AmprealizeHooks dataclass provides callback points for:
- Action tracking (audit trails, external action services)
- Compliance step recording
- Metrics/telemetry emission

This allows Amprealize to remain standalone while enabling rich
integrations when used within larger platforms like GuideAI.
