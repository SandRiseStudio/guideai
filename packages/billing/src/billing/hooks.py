Billing hooks for integration with external systems.

Hooks allow the billing package to remain standalone while enabling
integration with guideai services (ActionService, ComplianceService, etc.)
without introducing dependencies.

Usage:
    from billing.hooks import BillingHooks, BillingEvent

    class GuideAIBillingHooks(BillingHooks):
        async def on_subscription_created(self, event: BillingEvent) -> None:
            # Log to ActionService
