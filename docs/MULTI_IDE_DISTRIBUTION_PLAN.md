## Technical Implementation Details

### VSCode Extension Marketplace Submission

**Current Package Analysis:**
```json
{
  "name": "guideai-ide-extension",
  "displayName": "GuideAI IDE Extension",
  "description": "GuideAI IDE extension with real-time run monitoring and compliance validation",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "publisher": "guideai"
}
```

**Required Updates:**
1. **Versioning Strategy**: Move to `1.0.0` for initial release
2. **Marketplace Keywords**: Add search-optimized keywords
3. **Categories**: Move from "Other" to "Machine Learning" or "Developer Tools"
4. **Repository**: Add GitHub repository link
5. **Homepage**: Add product website URL
6. **License**: Add appropriate license
7. **Screenshots**: Add marketplace screenshots
8. **Badges**: Add build status and version badges

### Cursor Extension Adaptation

**MCP Server Compatibility:**
Your existing MCP server is already compatible with Cursor IDE since Cursor uses the same extension architecture as VSCode. The main work is:

1. **Wrapper Extension**: Create minimal Cursor extension that connects to your existing MCP server
2. **Configuration**: Adapt settings and commands for Cursor's specific APIs
3. **Testing**: Validate functionality in Cursor IDE environment

**Estimated Adaptation Effort:** 16-20 hours of development

### Cross-IDE Authentication

**Current Device Flow Implementation:**
Your OAuth2 device flow in `docs/DEVICE_FLOW_GUIDE.md` is already IDE-agnostic and works across:
- ✅ VSCode (via extension)
- ✅ Claude Desktop (via MCP)
- ✅ Cursor (via MCP server)
- ✅ Any MCP-compatible IDE

**No additional work required** for authentication parity.
