# Compliance Coverage Dashboard

> **Dashboard:** Checklist Completion & Audit Trail
> **Refresh:** Every 10 minutes
> **Data Source:** GuideAI Analytics Warehouse (DuckDB)

## Dashboard Purpose

Monitor compliance checklist execution across GuideAI runs to:
- Track coverage rates per checklist (target: ≥95%)
- Identify incomplete or skipped compliance steps
- Ensure audit requirements are met for regulated workflows
- Surface patterns in step completion/failure

ORDER BY execution_timestamp;
```

**Export Format:** CSV with full step details for audit submission

## Setup Instructions

1. Create dashboard: "Compliance Coverage"
2. Add 4 metric cards (avg coverage, total checklists, fully complete %, critical failures)
3. Add coverage trend line chart with 95% goal line
4. Add bar chart for checklist rankings
5. Add heatmap for step completion patterns
6. Add histogram for coverage distribution
7. Add recent executions table
8. Add low coverage audit queue table
9. Add checklist leaderboard table
10. Connect filters (date range, checklist, template)
11. Set auto-refresh to 10 minutes
12. Configure email alerts for coverage drops
13. Save to "PRD Metrics" collection with restricted access

## Security & Access Control

- **Restricted Access:** Compliance dashboard should have role-based access
- **Audit Log:** Track who views/exports compliance data
- **Data Retention:** Ensure compliance records meet regulatory retention requirements
- **Export Controls:** Limit CSV export to authorized personnel only

## Referenced Behaviors

- `behavior_handbook_compliance_prompt` – Checklist execution mandates
- `behavior_instrument_metrics_pipeline` – Coverage tracking feeds PRD metrics
- `behavior_lock_down_security_surface` – Audit access controls
