_Updated: 2025-10-15_

This snapshot captures current onboarding and adoption health across GuideAI surfaces. Metrics feed the Milestone Zero dashboard and seed telemetry events so live runs can update KPI progress toward PRD targets (70% behavior reuse, 30% token savings, 80% task completion, 95% compliance coverage).

| Surface | Sample Size | Avg Time to First Behavior (min) | Checklist Completion % | Behavior Search→Insert % | Behavior Reuse % | Token Savings % | Task Completion % | Compliance Coverage % |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| web | 24 | 12.4 | 82 | 68 | 72 | 28 | 84 | 93 |
| api | 16 | 15.1 | 75 | 61 | 66 | 24 | 80 | 91 |
| cli | 18 | 10.3 | 88 | 72 | 74 | 32 | 86 | 96 |
| ide | 12 | 14.8 | 79 | 64 | 69 | 26 | 81 | 90 |
| mcp | 10 | 13.9 | 77 | 63 | 70 | 25 | 82 | 92 |
