# ADR-0001: Adaptation of Agentic AI

## Status
Proposed

## Date
2026-01-21

## Context

### Problem Statement
The rapid proliferation of agentic AI systems has created a fragmented landscape of adaptation methods without a unified framework to understand their relationships, trade-offs, and appropriate use cases. This makes it difficult for researchers and practitioners to select optimal adaptation strategies for their specific needs.

### Research Source
- **Paper ID**: paper_383352572fc0
- **Paper Title**: Adaptation of Agentic AI
- **Evaluation Score**: 7.7/10
- **Verdict**: ADOPT

### Core Concept
This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy of adaptation strategies in agentic AI systems, categorizing them into four paradigms based on what is adapted (agent vs. tool) and the source of supervision signal (tool execution vs. agent output). The framework reveals that tool-centric adaptation (T1/T2) often achieves comparable performance to agent-centric approaches (A1/A2) while being dramatically more data-efficient and modular.

### Proposed Solution
The authors propose a 2x2 taxonomy organizing adaptation strategies along two axes: (1) what is adapted (agent parameters vs. external tools), and (2) the source of supervision (tool execution signals vs. agent output signals). This yields four paradigms: A1 (agent adaptation with tool execution signal), A2 (agent adaptation with agent output signal), T1 (agent-agnostic tool adaptation), and T2 (agent-supervised tool adaptation).

## Decision

Based on the research evaluation, we will **ADOPT** this approach:

The adaptation taxonomy provides valuable framework for behavior categorization with proven 70x efficiency gains, but needs modification to integrate smoothly with GuideAI's existing role-based system without adding user complexity.

## Implementation Strategy

### Affected Components
- {'path': 'guideai/services/behavior_service.py', 'what_changes': 'Add paradigm field to BehaviorMetadata model and migration'}
- {'path': 'guideai/services/trace_analysis_service.py', 'what_changes': 'Enhance detect_patterns() to classify behaviors by adaptation paradigm'}
- {'path': 'guideai/services/reflection_service.py', 'what_changes': 'Update reflect() to recommend paradigm based on trace characteristics'}
- {'path': 'guideai/behaviors/behavior_curate_behavior_handbook.py', 'what_changes': 'Add internal paradigm tracking without exposing to users'}
- {'path': 'guideai/services/research_service.py', 'what_changes': 'Add paradigm-aware evaluation metrics for behavior efficiency'}

### Proposed Steps
- {'order': 1, 'description': 'Add paradigm enum (A1/A2/T1/T2) to BehaviorMetadata as internal field, not exposed in UI', 'effort': 'S'}
- {'order': 2, 'description': 'Enhance TraceAnalysisService to detect paradigm from execution patterns (tool calls vs agent reasoning)', 'effort': 'M'}
- {'order': 3, 'description': 'Create paradigm detection heuristics: T1 (general tool use), T2 (specialized tools), A1 (prompting), A2 (would need retraining)', 'effort': 'M'}
- {'order': 4, 'description': 'Update behavior extraction to prefer T1/T2 patterns when detected, with efficiency metrics', 'effort': 'M'}
- {'order': 5, 'description': 'Add internal dashboard for paradigm distribution and efficiency tracking without user exposure', 'effort': 'S'}
- {'order': 6, 'description': 'Document paradigm selection guidelines for internal behavior curation team', 'effort': 'S'}

### Blocking Dependencies
- None identified

### Estimated Effort
- **Implementation Complexity**: MEDIUM
- **Maintenance Burden**: LOW
- **Effort Estimate**: M - 2-3 weeks of focused development

## Consequences

### Positive
- Aligns with research recommendation (score: 7.7/10)
- Addresses identified problem: The rapid proliferation of agentic AI systems has created a fragmented landscape of adaptation metho...
- Benefit 1: 70x data efficiency for behavior adaptation by using T2 methods instead of retraining
- Benefit 2: Clear framework for deciding when to extract behaviors (T1) vs. create agent-specific tools (T2) vs. retrain (A2)
- Benefit 3: Improved positioning and communication - we can explain our metacognitive reuse approach using established research terminology

### Negative / Concerns
- Concern 1: Adding paradigm categorization to behaviors increases cognitive load for users - they now need to understand both role (Student/Teacher/Strategist) and paradigm (A1/A2/T1/T2)
- Concern 2: The taxonomy might oversimplify - many real behaviors are hybrids that don't fit cleanly into one paradigm
- Concern 3: Without actual tool training infrastructure for T2, we'd only be implementing the categorization without the efficiency benefits

### Risks
- Risk 1: Premature optimization - categorizing behaviors by paradigm before we have enough data to validate the efficiency claims in our context
- Risk 2: User confusion if we expose paradigm selection in UI/CLI before having clear guidance on when to use each
