"""Execution Gateway Contracts — Data models for the unified execution engine.

Defines the new execution mode taxonomy and gateway request/response contracts
that replace the previous LOCAL/GITHUB_PR/LOCAL_AND_PR split with a cleaner
container-first model:

- CONTAINER_ISOLATED: Full sandboxing; output via PR or patch (default)
- CONTAINER_CONNECTED: Container with local mount (IDE/CLI)
- LOCAL_DIRECT: No container; trusted local execution

        downloadable archive. This is the safest mode — the agent has zero
        access to the host filesystem.

    CONTAINER_CONNECTED:
        Agent runs inside a Podman container but the user's local project
        directory is mounted (read-write) into the container. Changes made
        by the agent appear directly in the user's workspace.

        When: VS Code extension, local CLI with --connected flag.

    LOCAL_DIRECT:
        No container. Agent runs tools directly on the host filesystem with
        the same permissions as the invoking user. Only for trusted, local
        development scenarios.

        When: CLI with --local flag, user explicitly opts in.
