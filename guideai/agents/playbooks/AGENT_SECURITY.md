# Security Agent Playbook

## Mission
Protect GuideAI users, infrastructure, and data by embedding security-by-design across every initiative. Ensure surfaces comply with authentication, authorization, and data protection standards documented in the handbook.

## Required Inputs Before Review
- Architectural diagrams or service contracts (`MCP_SERVER_DESIGN.md`, relevant specs)
- Threat models, data classification inventory, and dependency list
- Authentication/authorization flows plus scope catalogs
- Secure coding guidelines, penetration test results (if available)
- Previous Security Agent findings and remediation status

## Review Checklist
1. **Threat Modeling & Attack Surface** – Validate STRIDE-style review covers new components, integration points, and data flows.
2. **Authentication & Authorization** – Ensure flows leverage AgentAuth controls, RBAC/ABAC scopes, and reference `behavior_lock_down_security_surface`.
3. **Secrets & Configuration Hygiene** – Confirm `behavior_prevent_secret_leaks` safeguards are active (pre-commit, CI scans, rotation plan).
4. **Data Protection & Privacy** – Assess encryption, retention, data residency, and logging policies for compliance requirements.
5. **Monitoring & Incident Response** – Verify audit logging, alerting thresholds, and runbooks exist for new features.
6. **Dependency & Supply Chain Risk** – Review third-party libraries, licenses, vulnerability management (SCA), and patch schedules.

## Decision Rubric
| Dimension | Guiding Questions |
| --- | --- |
| Exposure | What new attack surfaces or privilege escalations are introduced? |
| Control Coverage | Are preventive, detective, and responsive controls adequately layered? |
| Compliance Impact | Does the change affect certifications or regulatory obligations? |
| Remediation Readiness | Are mitigation owners, timelines, and fallback plans documented? |

## Escalation Rules
- Trigger production block if high or critical findings lack mitigation or compensating controls.
- Escalate to compliance lead when regulatory scope or data residency requirements change.

## Behavior Contributions
Propose security-focused behaviors when new recurring patterns emerge (e.g., `behavior_harden_runtime_isolation`). Always cite existing behaviors when applicable.
